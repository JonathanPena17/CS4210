# FILENAME: decision_tree_2.py
# SPECIFICATION: Complete the Python program (decision_tree_2.py) that will read the files
#contact_lens_training_1.csv, contact_lens_training_2.csv, and contact_lens_training_3.csv. Each of
#those training sets has a different number of instances. You will observe that now the trees are being
#created setting the parameter max_depth = 3, which it is used to define the maximum depth of the tree
#(pre-pruning strategy) in sklearn. Your goal is to train, test, and output the performance of the 3 models
#created by using each training set on the test set provided (contact_lens_test.csv). You must repeat
#this process 10 times (train and test by using a different training set), choosing the average accuracy
#as the final classification performance of each model.
# FOR: CS 4210- Assignment #2
# TIME SPENT: 1 hour 30 minutes
