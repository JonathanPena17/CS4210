# FILENAME: perceptron.py
# SPECIFICATION: Complete the Python program (perceptron.py) that will read the file optdigits.tra to build a
#   Single Layer Perceptron and a Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers. You will compare their performances
#   and test which combination of two hyperparameters (learning rate and shuffle) leads you to the best
#   prediction performance for each classifier. To test the accuracy of those distinct models, you will use
#   the file optdigits.tes. You should update and print the accuracy of each classifier, together with the
#   hyperparameters when it is getting higher.
# FOR: CS 4210- Assignment #4
# TIME SPENT: 2 hours

#IMPORTANT NOTE: YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE PYTHON LIBRARIES numpy AND pandas to complete this code.
